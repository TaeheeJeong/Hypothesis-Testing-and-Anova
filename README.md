##Model Interpretation for ANOVA:

When examining the association between urban population (categorical explanatory) and life expectancy at birth(quantitative response), an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed that city where urban rate is more than 50% reported life expectation is much longer (Mean= 74.1, s.d. ±6.92)  compared to rural where urban rate is less than 50% (Mean=62.9, s.d. ± 9.42).  

F value is 87.62 from the OLS table and p value is a very small as 2.62e-17, simply <.0001.

## Model Interpretation for post hoc ANOVA results:

ANOVA revealed that among daily, young adult smokers (my sample), number of cigarettes smoked per day (collapsed into 5 ordered categories, which is the categorical explanatory variable) and number of nicotine dependence symptoms (quantitative response variable) were significantly associated, F (4, 1308)=11.79, p=0001. Post hoc comparisons of mean number of nicotine dependence symptoms by pairs of cigarettes per day categories revealed that those individuals smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day (i.e. 11 to 15, 16 to 20 and >20) reported significantly more nicotine dependence symptoms compared to those smoking 10 or fewer cigarettes per day (i.e. 1 to 5 and 6 to 10). All other comparisons were statistically similar.
