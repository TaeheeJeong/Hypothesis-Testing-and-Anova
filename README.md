##Model Interpretation for ANOVA:

When examining the association between urban population (categorical explanatory) and life expectancy at birth(quantitative response), an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed that city where urban rate is more than 50% reported life expectation is much longer (Mean= 74.1, s.d. ±6.92)  compared to rural where urban rate is less than 50% (Mean=62.9, s.d. ± 9.42).  

F value is 87.62 from the OLS table and p value is a very small as 2.62e-17, simply <.0001.

## Model Interpretation for post hoc ANOVA results:

ANOVA revealed that alcohol consumption per adult (liter) (collapsed into 4 quantile categories, which is the categorical explanatory variable) and  life expectancy at birth (years) (quantitative response variable) were significantly associated.

F (4, 176) value is 8.595 from the OLS table and p value is a very small as 2.39e-05, simply <.0001.

Post hoc comparisons of mean number of alcohol consumption per adult categories revealed that 25% quantitle (2.625~ 5.92 liters)  reported life expectation is 9 years shorter compared to 75% quantitle (9.925000~ 23.010 liters).
