##Model Interpretation for ANOVA:

When examining the association between urban population (categorical explanatory) and life expectancy at birth(quantitative response), an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed that city where urban rate is more than 50% reported life expectation is much longer (Mean= 74.1, s.d. ±6.92)  compared to rural where urban rate is less than 50% (Mean=62.9, s.d. ± 9.42).  

F value is 87.62 from the OLS table and p value is a very small as 2.62e-17, simply <.0001.
